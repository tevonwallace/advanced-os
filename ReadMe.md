# Advanced Operating Systems
## CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This application is used to process tasks using CPU Scheduling Algorithms. Processes can either be read from file or entered manually.


## Project Configuration
### This project was created in Xcode. 
### The C Language Dialect was set to GNU17 [-std=gnu17]
### C++ Language Dialect set to GNU++20 [-std=gnu++20]

## Executing a Single Algorithm

Clone the repository. Open in Xcode

Update the default "Scheme" and change the "Working Directory" to the location of the cloned repository.

Once the Scheme is updated. Go ahead and run the application.

## Executing Multiple Algorithms
You may select multiple algorithms by using the hyphen "-" delimiter. You can also show the waiting and turn around time for process in each algorithm by using the "-all" parameter.
